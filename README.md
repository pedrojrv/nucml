NucML is an end-to-end python-based supervised machine learning pipeline for enhanced bias-free nuclear data generation and evaluation to support the advancement of next-generation nuclear systems.

It offers capabilities that allows researchers to navigate through each step of the ML-based nuclear data cross section evaluation pipeline. Some of the supported activities include include:

- dataset parsing and compilation of reaction data,
- exploratory data analysis,
- easy data manipulation,
- feature engineering,
- model training and evaluation,
- validation via criticality benchmarks

Some of the inherit benefits of this approach are the reduced human-bias in the generation and solution and the fast iteration times. Resulting data from these models can aid the current NDE and help decisions in uncertain scenarios.
